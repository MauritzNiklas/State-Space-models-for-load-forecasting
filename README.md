# State-Space-models-for-load-forecasting
Code for my Master's Thesis: Development of different multivariate electricity load forecasting methods.

The formulas for the recursive training of parameters and the recursive prediction procedures can be found in the file `Formulas_ReadMe.ipynb`.

A detailed explanation of the rationale behind the formulas and of the prediction procedure can be found in the thesis, added as pdf file `State-Space Models for Multivariate Electricity Load Forecasting - 16-1.pdf`.

In the `code` folder, the MATLAB code is present. The main functions are the `train.m` and the `prediction.m` functions. In the `main.m` function, an example on how to use these functions is shown.
